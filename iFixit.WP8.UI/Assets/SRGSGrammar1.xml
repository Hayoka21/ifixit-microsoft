  <!--Sample SRGS Grammar to show syntax.
      The rule element defines a grammar rule. A rule element 
      contains text or XML elements that define what speakers can 
      say, and the order in which they can say it.-->

        either optional or repeatable (in other words, in cases where the repeat attribute must be used).
        The repeat attribute on the item element indicates that the words in the one-of element can be
        spoken zero or one time, making them optional-->

    <!-- <item repeat="0-1"> in the </item> The ruleref element specifies a reference by the containing rule to another rule, either in the 
        same grammar or in an external 	grammar. The referenced rule defines user input that must be 
        matched for successful recognition of the containing rule. This element is especially useful for
        reusing rules and grammars that contain content which does not change frequently, such as a list 
        of cities or a rule for recognizing phone numbers.-->
